    <p>At school I played table tennis and swam twice a day with the club. At college and university, I played basketball, volleyball and 5-a-side football.
        Nowadays, I walk, play chess and on occasions go to the pool. (Please hover over the photos below for more information)</p>

          <p>I used to swim twice a day with the Thornlow Tornadoes swimming club. When the school closed down the club moved to another pool in Portland 
            and continued its operation until 2021. Now the only thing left is good memories. I go to the pool on occasions and still love a race!</p>

          <p> I played volleyball at college. The team in this photograph won the south west England championship and came fourth in the UK. At university we 
            won East of England. Nowadays I do not have the same knees to spike or the energy to dive.</p>

          <p>I always enjoyed playing 5-a-side although nobody passed me the ball. Later I moved into the goal and had the ball all the time. Usually, I picked it from 
            the back of the net. </p>
